# rehamove
Libraries allowing Python and C# control of a device for electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), the RehaMove 3 (from the manufacturer Hasomed). Builds and documentation for these libraries was created by me, with the help of my advisor, Pedro Lopes from the University of Chicago.

Build/library files: [Lab Repository](https://github.com/humancomputerintegration/rehamove-integration-lib)
Documentation/how-to-use: [Lab Webpage](https://lab.plopes.org/rehamove.html)

All feedback and questions are welcome. You can contact me or my advisor for this project, Pedro Lopes.
