# rehamove
Libraries allowing Python and C# control of a device for electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)

The public builds and documentation for these libraries can be found [on our lab page](https://lab.plopes.org/rehamove.html)! All feedback and questions are welcome. You can contact me or my advisor for this project, Pedro Lopes.
